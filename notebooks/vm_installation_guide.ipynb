    "\n",
    "A virtual machine is an emulation of a physical computer that runs an operating system and applications just like a physical machine. However, instead of running on its own hardware, it runs on a host system. Virtual machines allow us to run multiple operating systems simultaneously on the same computer. In this course the lab will use Ubuntu (Linux) to use ROS 2, and all the groups will get to borrow a computer with Ubuntu. However, if you want to also use your own computer, then installing a Virtual Machine with Ubuntu would be a good solution. This guide will show you how."
