    "\n",
    "ROS 2 has support for a variaty of joysticks through the `joy` package. This tutorial will go into the how the joystick works with ROS 2, while also practicing how to effectively use the command line. \n",

    "### Run the joystick\n",
    "To test it out, make sure the joystick is connected to your computer through wire or bluetooth. To start up the joystick run \n",

    "What is interesting to look at here is the `axes` values and the `buttons` values. Now you can play around with the joystick, and see what buttons/sticks changes what values.\n",

    "\n",

    "import rclpy\n",
    "from rclpy.node import Node\n",
    "from sensor_msgs.msg import Joy\n",

    "class JoystickNode(Node):\n",
    "    def __init__(self):\n",
    "        super().__init__('joystick_node')\n",
    "        self.joy_subscriber = self.create_subscription(Joy, '/joy', self.joy_callback, 10)\n",
    "\n",
    "    def joy_callback(self, msg: Joy):\n",
    "        pass\n",
    "\n",
    "def main(args=None):\n",
    "    rclpy.init(args=args)\n",
    "    node = JoystickNode()\n",
    "    rclpy.spin(node)\n",
    "    rclpy.shutdown()\n",
    "\n",
    "if __name__ == '__main__':\n",
    "    main()\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Imports\n",
    "The rclpy import lets us start up the node (spin). The Node import is like a template class which we want to inherit from, to gain access to for example the `create_subscription` method. This method allows us to create a subscriber to a topic. In our case, as we found out above, the topic name is `/joy` and the type is [Joy](https://docs.ros.org/en/noetic/api/sensor_msgs/html/msg/Joy.html). The `callback` is a method that will be called each time new messages are received on the topic. The callback method is where you decide what to do with the incoming message. The last part with the main function is just there to make sure that the node will run when the script is run.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Modify the joy_callback\n",
    "Recall from the part where we used `echo` to see the content of the message. From there we see that the message has three fields: header, axes and buttons. In the [Joy documentation](https://docs.ros.org/en/noetic/api/sensor_msgs/html/msg/Joy.html) we see that axes and buttons are lists. If we want to access the list of axes and print it we can do\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def joy_callback(self, msg: Joy):\n",
    "    axes = msg.axes\n",
    "    print(axes)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This script can be used to play around with the joystick values. All you need to do is run the joy_node and the script. For your task in the lab, you need to identify which buttons and axes belongs to which index."
